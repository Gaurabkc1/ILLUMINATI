		What is Cybersecurity?</h1><br><br>

Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, attacks, damage, or theft. It encompasses a wide range of technologies, processes, and practices designed to safeguard digital information and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.
<br><br>
<h3>Key Components of Cybersecurity:</h3>
<br><br>
 1. Authentication and Access Control:
   Establishing the identity of users and ensuring that they have the appropriate level of access is fundamental to cybersecurity. Authentication methods such as passwords, biometrics, and multi-factor authentication help verify the legitimacy of users.
<br><br>
 2. Firewalls and Network Security:
   Firewalls act as barriers between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks, controlling the flow of traffic and preventing unauthorized access. Network security measures, including encryption and intrusion detection systems, are crucial for protecting data in transit.
<br><br>
 3. Endpoint Security:
   Securing individual devices such as computers, smartphones, and tablets is essential to prevent malware, ransomware, and other malicious software from compromising sensitive data.
<br><br>
 4. Cryptography:
   Cryptography involves the use of algorithms to secure data and communication by converting it into an unreadable format. Encryption and decryption processes play a pivotal role in protecting information from unauthorized access.
<br><br>
 5. Security Awareness and Training:
   Human error is a significant factor in cybersecurity incidents. Education and training programs help individuals recognize potential threats, understand security best practices, and contribute to a culture of cybersecurity within an organization.
<br><br>
 6. Incident Response and Disaster Recovery:
   Developing a robust incident response plan and disaster recovery strategy is crucial for minimizing the impact of a security breach. Quick and effective responses can prevent further damage and ensure business continuity.
